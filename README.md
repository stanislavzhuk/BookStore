Description:

This team project is an online [BookStore](https://stanislavzhuk.github.io/BookStore/) implemented using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. We used an API to fetch book data, added Firebase authentication to store the shopping list in the user's account database, pagination for easy page navigation, included a Loader (spinner) for asynchronous requests, and created a responsive design for viewing on various devices.

📚 The web application provides the following features:

📖 User authentication to access the "Shopping List" section;

📖 Convenient book search by categories;

📖 Ability to purchase books on pages of well-known online stores;

📖 Book database management through adding and deleting books in the "Shopping List" tab;

📖 Pagination for easy page navigation in the "Shopping List" section;

📖 Ability to support Ukraine and its people by visiting any website from the "Support Ukraine" list 💙💛;

📖 Changing the current website theme to a different one (dark or light).
